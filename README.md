Hey! I'm Sam Greenwood, a passionate and creative individual with a diverse set of skills. My journey in the vast universe of design and development has been fueled by a love for crafting unique and visually captivating experiences. Away from the screen, I find inspiration in everything our universe has to offer. When I'm not working you can find me exploring all New Brunswick over with my family and two black labs. Whether you're interested in my designs, marketing, development projects, or just want to share a cosmic conversation, I'm always open to new connections and collaborations. ðŸš€ðŸŒŒ
